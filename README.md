#Â Scripts and other utilities

This is where I store some Python scripts and other utilities. 
Some of them are hardcoded because they supposed to be used only by myself. 

* [backup-dd.sh](https://github.com/Nairwolf/scripts/blob/master/backup-dd.sh) : 
This bash script use *rsync* to backup and synchronize all my personal data on my hard 
drive

* [brute_force_geocaching](https://github.com/Nairwolf/scripts/blob/master/brute_force_geocaching.py) :
This is a python script used to solve a programming challenge for a local geocaching 
event. I had a sha512 signature and I had to find the coordinates who generate this 
signature.

* [check_chinese.py](https://github.com/Nairwolf/scripts/blob/master/check_chinese.py) :
As I'm learning chinese, this script reads this [file](https://gitlab.com/Nairwolf/Chinese/blob/master/voca_et_phrases.md) 
and verify if it's well formated. 

* [practice_chinese.py](https://github.com/Nairwolf/scripts/blob/master/pratice_chinese.py)
It reads this [file](https://gitlab.com/Nairwolf/Chinese/blob/master/voca_et_phrases.md) 
and asks me if I know my vocabulary

* [share_expenses.py](https://github.com/Nairwolf/scripts/blob/master/share_expenses.py) :
It reads a text file where it's written expenses of two people and compute money you need 
to give to refund your partner.
